# Frontend Test @Belatrix
Test for Belatrix.
Instructions to run the project:
1. Clone the repo.
2. `node index.js` to populate the JSON files with 'file.txt', which is the original plain text sent on the test.
3. Change folder to '/client' and do `yarn start`to render the React.js client.

Note: The JSON files when first running the project are empty, Step 2 is mandatory in order to have data to render.
